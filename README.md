# Hello-World
Learning the ropes!
Think this is what I am supposed to do.....

Hello Everyone!

A few months back I started teaching myself code as a hobby. Right now I am in
the process of learning Python and wanted to read over some real world code to 
get a feel for what it is like. In the future, I am planning on trying to learn more
languages as well as maintaining and using my knowledge of Python. Best wishes to 
anyone who reads this!
